## SLIDE 3: Current Market - Fragmented & Broken
**The Reality of Buying Property in India Today**

### The Fragmentation Problem:
1. **No Single Source of Truth**: Buyers contact 15+ people (agents, lawyers, inspectors, banks)
2. **Duplicate & Fake Listings**: Same property listed 5x at different prices across portals
3. **Closed Networks**: 70% of premium deals happen via 'insider' referrals only
4. **Individual Due Diligence**: Each buyer re-verifies the same Title/RERA/Quality docs
5. **Zero Transparency**: Builders manage inventory on Excel; agents sell stale units

---

## SLIDE 4: The Trust Crisis (Specifics)
**Why 43% of Buyers Abandon Transactions**

### Critical Pain Points:
- **43% abandonment rate** due to 'document uncertainty' (PropEquity 2024)
- **6-8 months** average time spent in 'verification limbo' before booking
- **No unified service layer**: Legal, KYC, Tax, and Inspection are completely siloed
- **₹2-5 Cr annual loss** per builder due to 'inventory leakage' (unsold but unlisted)
- **30% lower earnings** for agents due to lead overlap and commission disputes

---

## SLIDE 5: PropMubi Solution - The Network Effect
**All Professionals & Digital Tools in One Canonical System**

### The PropMubi Network:
✅ **Unified Artifact Database**: Legal (Title Search), RERA, Quality Audits accessible in one click  
✅ **Builder Master Control**: Real-time inventory sync across all channels (no Excel)  
✅ **Agent Marketplace**: Protected leads + Service fulfillment (KYC, Legal, Tax)  
✅ **Digital Services Hub**: Gupshup, Signzy, Stripe, Knight Frank, JLL integrated  

**Result**: Buyers get verified truth in 48 hours vs. 6 months traditional diligence.

---

## SLIDE 6: Unit Economics - CAC & LTV
**High-Margin, Capital-Efficient Growth Model**

### Key Metrics:
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: ₹8,500 per verified buyer
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: ₹1,85,000 per buyer (3-year horizon)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: **21.7x** (Best-in-class for PropTech)
- **Payback Period**: **4.2 months** (vs. 18 months for listing portals)
- **Gross Margin**: **78%** on transaction + service fees

### Why This Works:
- Multi-sided revenue (buyer, builder, agent, services)
- High repeat rate (buyers return for resale/rental services)
- Network effects reduce CAC over time

## SLIDE 11: VC Grill & Moat
**Answering the Hard Questions**

### Q1: How do you compete with 99acres/MagicBricks?
**A**: We own the **Transaction Intent**, they own the **Search Query**. We don't just list; we verify, lock, and fulfill. Our buyers are 10x more qualified.

### Q2: What is your data moat?
**A**: Our **'Artifact Database'** of verified specs (electrical, plumbing, title deeds) is uncopiable. Each property requires 40+ hours of schema mapping. Generic portals can't replicate this.

### Q3: How do you scale builder adoption?
**A**: We position as the **'System of Record'** for premium builders. They adopt us to justify premium pricing to HNI/institutional buyers who demand auditability.

# PROPMUBI - PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

**Version:** 2.0 (Trust OS Manifest)
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** In Execution

## 1. Product Vision
**"We didn’t digitize real estate. We removed ambiguity from it."**

PropMubi is a **Real Estate Decision & Transaction Operating System** ("Trust OS"). It replaces the fragmented, document-heavy, and opaque real estate journey with a system of **360° Verifiable Truth**.

### Core Invariants
1.  **Canonical Truth**: One property, one listing, one price. No duplicates.
2.  **Consent-First**: No lead exists without explicit buyer consent.
3.  **Role Governance**: Agents and Builders are verified, regulated actors.
4.  **AI as Explainer**: AI explains data; it never invents it.

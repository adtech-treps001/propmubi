# 📜 PROPMUBI TRUST OS: THE MANIFESTO (v2026)

**Mission**: "We didn't digitize real estate. We removed ambiguity from it."

---

## 1. CORE INVARIANTS (THE "NEVER BREAK" RULES)
*   **One Property = One Listing**: No duplicates, ever.
*   **One Truth**: A single canonical `project_id`, `tower_id`, `unit_id`.
*   **AI as Explainer**: AI explains data; it never assumes or hallucinates prices.
*   **Consent First**: No lead exists without explicit buyer consent.

---

## 2. THE THREE PILLARS

### A. The Digital Twin (Spatial Truth)
*   **Brochure-less**: Replaced by living, verified "Project Profiles".
*   **Geo-Spatial**: Satellite/GIS layers, Sunlight/Wind simulation.
*   **Structural Truth**: Ceiling heights, plumbing points, wall thickness (from CAD).
*   **Hierarchy**: Project -> Tower -> Floor -> Unit -> Room.

### B. The Trust Graph (Legal/Financial Truth)
*   **Legal Score**: RERA + Court Cases + Land Title (Explainable AI).
*   **Financial Identity**: Buyer Buying Power assertion.
*   **Builder Score**: Execution + Compliance + Bank Confidence (No subjective stars).

### C. The Human Layer (Agent/Builder Truth)
*   **Agent as Sensor**: Ingests "Soft Supply" (off-market/village) via WhatsApp.
*   **Builder as Partner**: Canonical data source.
*   **One Lead = One Advisor**: Strict governance prevents lead theft.

---

## 3. PERSONA-BASED UX (THE LENS)
The *data* is canonical, but the *view* adapts to the user:
*   **Family**: Sees Schools, Sunlight, Safety, Community.
*   **Investor**: Sees Yields, Exit Liquidity, Price Trends.
*   **NRI**: Sees Asset Management, Legal Clarity, Distance from Airport.
*   **Farmer/Rural**: Sees Road Access, Zoning, Encroachment Risks.

---

## 4. AGENT NETWORK (SUPPLY SENSORS)
*   **Role**: Not just sales, but **Supply Discovery**.
*   **Village/Mandal Agents**: Critical for capture of India's informal market.
*   **Governance**:
    *   No anonymous listings.
    *   "Social Signal" flag for unverified properties.
    *   Performance-based lead allocation.

---

## 5. MARKETING AS TRUTH
*   **Principle**: Marketing is a byproduct of Truth data.
*   **Automation**: Auto-generate Reels/Posts from *verified* metrics only.
*   **Channels**: WhatsApp-first (India Strategy).
*   **Content**: "Why Project A > Project B" (Comparative, not promotional).

---

## 6. REVENUE MODEL
*   **Buyer**: Subscription for Confidence (Tiers 1-4).
*   **Builder**: SaaS Subscription + Success Fees.
*   **Bank/Service**: Commission on ecosystem services.

## 1. THE BUYER: "Risk-Averse Rohan"
**Profile**: IT Professional, 32, First-time homebuyer.
**Mindset**: "I am terrified of losing my life savings to a stalled project."

| Stage | Rohan's Pain Point 😫 | PropMubi Solution 🛡️ | Screen Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discovery** | "Every listing on portals looks same. Prices are fake bait." | **Verified Feed**: Algorithmically verified prices. 100% Truth. | `/consumer` |
| **Verification** | "Is this land legally clear? I don't understand these docs." | **Trust Score**: Simple 0-100 score + "Explainable AI" summary. | `/projects/[id]` |
| **Decision** | "Will the builder deliver on time? They all promise big." | **Delivery Analytics**: Historical delivery graph shown upfront. | `/builder` (Public View) |

**The "Aha!" Moment**: Rohan sees **My Home Sayuk** has a Trust Score of **94/100** while a nearby cheaper project is **42/100**. He chooses safety.

## 2. THE AGENT: "Local Expert Suresh"
**Profile**: 10 years experience, operates in Narsingi, highly connected but low-tech.
**Mindset**: "Portals steal my leads. I have the best inventory but no reach."

| **Credibility** | "Clients don't trust me because I work from a small shop." | **Microsite**: Instant, professional digital portfolio with "Verified" badge. | `/microsite` |
| **Closing** | "Buyers ghost me after getting the property details." | **Lead Governance**: "One Buyer = One Agent" rule. His lead is locked. | `/agent` (Queue) |

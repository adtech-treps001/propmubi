# 🎯 PropMubi - VC Pitch Deck

**Real Estate Operating System with Canonical Truth**

---

## Slide 1: Problem

### The Real Estate Chaos
- **Duplicate listings** across 100+ platforms
- **Opaque pricing** - same unit, 10 different prices
- **Lead theft** - agents compete, buyers confused
- **No trust** - 60% transactions fail due to ambiguity

**Market Size**: India real estate = $200B annually

---

## Slide 2: Solution - Trust OS

### One Property · One Listing · One Buyer · One Price

**PropMubi** = Canonical system of truth for real estate. We replace brochures with **Living Project Profiles**.

- **Truth Invariants**: One canonical entry for every unit. No duplicates.
- **Explainable Legal Score**: Ownership chain and RERA status explainable by Al.
- **Structural Truth**: CAD-level precision for every room and plumbing point.
- **AI Governance**: AI explains data; it never assumes. Sources mandatory.

---

## Slide 3: How It Works

### The Truth Engine Pipeline

**1. The Spatial Layer (Digital Twin)**
- Satellite monitoring + GIS data.
- Sunlight/Wind simulations (not marketing claims).
- Gate-to-Key navigation.

**2. The Legal & Financial Graph**
- eCourts + RERA + Survey maps ingestion.
- Buyer Buying Power assertion (Consent-based).
- Multi-dimensional Builder Trust Index.

**3. The Amplification Layer (Marketing Automation)**
- Marketing as a byproduct of Truth.
- Auto-generate Reels/Posts from verified data only.
- WhatsApp-first orchestration (India strategy).

## Slide 4: Product Features

### For Buyers (The Guarded Path) 🛡️
✓ **Persona Comparison**: Investor vs Family view of the same data.
✓ **Confidence Subscriptions**: Pay for risk reduction, not listings.
✓ **Structural Search**: Search by ceiling height or balcony orientation.

### For Builders (The B2B OS) 🏗️

## Slide 6: Moat - The Truth Graph

### Why This Can't Be Copied

**1. Canonical Logic**
- Hard logic preventing duplicates and price manipulation.
- High switching costs: Builders lose their "Trust Certificate" if they leave.

**2. Supply Ingestion (The Sensor Network)**
- Capturing "Soft Supply" via local agents that never reaches portals.
- 52+ specific agent governance rules.

**3. Regulatory-Safe AI**
- Domain-specific RAG (Law, Structural, Architecture).
- Citation-first architecture.

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape

| Platform | Category | Limitation |
|----------|----------|------------|
| 99acres, MagicBricks | Classifieds | Lead resale, duplicate spam, no truth |
| NoBroker | C2C Portal | No builder integration, no tech-trust |
| PropTiger / Anarock | Advisory | Relationship-driven, not system-driven |
| **PropMubi** | **Trust OS** | **Canonical Truth + Automation** |

**Differentiation**: We're not a listing platform. We're the operating system.
